# alusia.tech - my portfolio website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website, a dedicated space I've created to showcase my skills and add a personalized touch to my future job applications. This site is more than just a portfolio; it's a reflection of my journey and growth as a professional.

## Project Overview

Developed using TypeScript and React, this website was initially conceived as a practice ground to refine my TypeScript skills. Over time, it has evolved into a comprehensive portfolio and a platform to share my professional insights and achievements.

### Key Features

- **TypeScript and React**: Utilizing these modern technologies, the website offers a robust and dynamic user experience, demonstrating my proficiency in front-end development.
- **Blog Page**: A recent addition, the blog page is a space where I share my thoughts, experiences, and notable achievements, providing a deeper insight into my professional life.
- **Firebase Integration**: Leveraging Firebase's Firestore and Storage, the website ensures that content updates are seamless and do not require redeployment, showcasing my skills in database management and cloud services.

### Purpose and Vision

The primary goal of this website is to create a unique and engaging platform where I can not only display my technical skills but also connect with potential employers and peers in the industry. It serves as a living document of my professional journey, continually updated with new experiences and learnings.

### Feedback and Contributions

I hope you find this website informative and insightful. Your feedback is invaluable, and I welcome any suggestions or contributions you may have. Feel free to explore, and thank you for visiting!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
